NoteGo is your go-to application for managing and enhancing your workflow. Built with Next.js, this application provides real-time notifications for your apps' events. It ensures secure authentication with Clerk, smooth database operations with Drizzle ORM, and reliable cloud storage with Firebase.

NoteGo takes user interaction to the next level by integrating OpenAI for image prompts and AI autocomplete. It also offers a cloud notebook for effortless note-taking and a KDB UI for efficient data querying and visualization.
