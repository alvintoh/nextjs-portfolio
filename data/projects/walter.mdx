Walter is a comprehensive weather application that provides detailed weather forecasts for a wide range of cities and geographical locations. With Walter, you can easily access the current day's weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

But Walter's capabilities go beyond just the current day. It also offers a 7-day weather forecast, allowing you to plan your week ahead with ease. Whether you're planning a trip, an outdoor event, or just want to know what to expect from the weather, Walter has you covered.

One of Walter's standout features is its ability to search for your current location. This means you can get accurate, real-time weather updates no matter where you are.
