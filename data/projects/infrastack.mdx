Built upon years of development expertise, InfraTech provides Docker Compose configurations for a comprehensive tech stack. It includes ClickHouse for column-oriented database management, MongoDB for flexible NoSQL storage, PostgreSQL for reliable relational data handling, and Kafka for real-time data streaming. For workflow orchestration, we've incorporated Dagster and Prefect, known for their data-centric and Pythonic approach.

This setup is tailored for scalable, data-intensive applications, offering a containerized environment that ensures seamless integration and scalability. As we continue to explore and experiment with new technologies, expect more infrastructure categories to be added to this ever-evolving repository.

You can see how to use InfraStack in the project's [README](https://github.com/alvintoh/tech-infra-stack/blob/main/README.md)
