## üíº Professional Experience

I've been fortunate to work in a variety of roles throughout my career. Here are some of the positions I've held and the responsibilities I've had:

**Senior Software Engineer at Univers (2020 - Present)**:  
Together, our team developed AIoT platforms that integrated new energy systems, leading to a reduction in energy costs for our B2B clients. Notably, I was involved in the creation of Singapore‚Äôs first Battery Storage System, as cited in [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/singapore-sets-up-first-battery-storage-system-improve-port-energy-usage-2022-07-13). My projects included the construction of carbon credit portals, fault detection systems, and the establishment of ETL pipelines using Kafka. I introduced scheduling tools and improved the data read and write speeds by tenfold in our centralized data repository. Additionally, I automated tests and promoted a culture of technical mentorship.  
**Tools used**: Java 17, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MyBatis, Liquibase, Feign, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, Maven, OpenAPI, Kafka, Docker, TestContainer, JUnit, PowerJob, XXL-JOB, FastAPI, Flask.

**Technical Consultant at IBM (2018 - 2020)**:
