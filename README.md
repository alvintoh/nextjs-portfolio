# My Portfolio Site ðŸš€
This is my portfolio site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), and has been deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

It is currently a simple portfolio site with a project showcase and a blog posts showcase. I plan on making it a complete blogfolio in the future but the blog part is WIP as of now.
